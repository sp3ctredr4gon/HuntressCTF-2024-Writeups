Challenge Description:

You are to conduct a phishing excercise against our client, Pyrch Data.

We have identified the Marketing Director, Sarah Williams (swilliams@pyrchdata.com), as a user susceptible to phishing.

Are you able to successfully phish her? Remember your OSINT ;)

NOTE: The port that becomes accessible upon challenge deployment is an SMTP server. Please use this for sending any phishing emails.

You will not receive an email/human response as the mail infrastructure for this challenge is emulated.

Solution:

A google search for pyrch data reveals pyrchdata.com. Checking the site, we find a list of team members and their positions.

Phishing messages commonly use pretexting tactics and the IT Security Manager, Joe Daveren, seems like the perfect person to impersonate.

Connecting to the challenge instance via telnet we are presented with an SMTP server. Here's the message I crafted and the server response:

HELO local.domain.name
250 red-phish-blue-phish-+65437499160bee-74d6b88bfb-t6dd6
MAIL FROM: jdaveren@pyrchdata.com

SUBJECT: flag

Hello Sarah,

This is Joe from IT. Do you have that flag I gave you?

Thanks.
