Challenge Description: Wham! Bam! Amazon is entering the hacking business! Can you buy a flag?

Connecting to the challenge server, we are presented with the Whamazon instance.

We are presented with choices:
  1. Examine your inventory
  2. Buy from Whamazon
  3. Quit

There is currently nothing in our inventory, so we can choose to buy. Choosing this option shows that we have $50 in our wallet.

The options to buy are:
  1. Apples
  2. Oranges
  3. Video Games
  4. Game Console
  5. Television
  6. House
  7. Flag
  8. Nothing

Choosing to buy a flag reveals that the flag costs $1000000000, and we only have $50. Apples, however, only cost $3

Fortunately for us, when choosing how many of an item to buy, Whamazon doesn't validate user input. We can choose to buy a negative number of Apples and be given more money!

Buying -1000000000 Apples, we receive $3000000000. Now we have enough to buy the flag!

It won't be that easy though, Whamazon won't let us have it without a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. It says that it won't choose Scissors and asks us to make a choice.

Assuming that Whamazon isn't telling the truth, I chose Rock. Whamazon also chose Rock. Next, I guessed that Whamazon may actually only be able to make one choice, and that it would NOT choose scissors. I was correct, and won the game. Whamazon then deposited the flag in my inventory.

Going back and checking my inventory revealed the flag: flag{18bdd83cee5690321bb14c70465d3408}
