Challenge Description: Don't believe everything you see on the Internet! Anyway, have you heard this intro soundtrack from Half-Life 3?

Solution: 

The file included is named Half-Life_3_OST.mp3, but it won’t play. 

Running the command ‘file Half-Life_3_OST.mp3’ shows that it is in fact an .png file. Changing the extension and opening the file gives the flag.
